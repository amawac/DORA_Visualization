# DORA_Visualization

Welcome to the DNA Origami Rotor Analyzation_Visualization repository!
Here you will find the code used to visualize the rotation of a florescent rotor tip of a DNA Origami Rotor attached to a strand of dsDNA being fed into an enzyme.
In this repository you will find:

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO EDIT THE CODE:
make sure to download the following into the same jupyter notebook folder:
1. DORA_Visualization.ipynb -> This is the FULL version of the code in Jupyter Notebook format, if you are trying to make edits or are curious about the code, download  file
2. RecBCD.csv (this is a sample .csv file, make sure you download this!! The code is set up to call this file and it is a good way to check for code functionality)

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO JUST WANT TO VISUALIZE THEIR TRAJECTORIES:
Make sure to download the following into the same jupyter notebook folder:
1. DORA_Visualization_Interface.ipynb (This is where you will be interacting with the code)
2. DORA_Visualization_code.py (this is the full code function in a .py file, this will be called by the interface)
3. RecBCD.csv (this is a sample .csv file, make sure you download this!! The code is set up to call this file and it is a good way to check for code functionality)

*Note RecBCD.csv is real data visualizing the activity of a RecBCD enzyme. See: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1397-7
